Gerrit Vim plugin.

Why it exists. A great way to learn VIM scripting and building plugins.

This plugin is meant to do a few simple things as a part of its first draft:

1) Pull the list of your changes(reviews you own) from gerrit code review

2) Select a specific change and look at the latest patch set

3) Display a selected file in the patch set along with a quick fix window.
The quick fix window will show all the abbreviated comments(140 chars) and selecting a comment
will inline it with the file's contents with highlighting.

Later versions may allow one to see diffs and other things.
